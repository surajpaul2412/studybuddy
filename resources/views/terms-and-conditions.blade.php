                            <ul>
                                <li>the fees charged in the Invoice should be as has been explicitly agreed with upfront in the Proposal.

If after 24 hours the Buyer has not responded to this notification the funds in the Escrow Account, up to the unpaid Invoice amount, will be automatically processed and will remain at the discretion of COLLAR for approval.</li>
                                <li>if the Buyer pays the invoice or funds are utilized in accordance with d) above, COLLAR and the Seller will be entitled to assume that the Buyer is satisfied with the Job and does not have a dispute of any kind in relation to the Job.

                        <li>Seller’s Account must be in good standing.</li>

                    <h4>3.4 Contests</h4>
                    <p>Buyers can create a (“Contest”) by completing the “Contest Post” form and by paying the (“Contest Fee”) in accordance with the instructions provided on COLLAR. Sellers can participate in a Contest by submitting an entry. Every Contest is listed in the “Contest listings” page of COLLAR, and Sellers can submit their entries in accordance with the duration and terms of the Contest as defined by COLLAR.</p>
                    <p>Sellers may submit an unlimited number of entries in formats defined by the type of contest as specified on the submission form. During the submission period, Buyers, Sellers and Guests will be able to view, report and rate the designs submitted for the Contest. All entries must comply with the Contest description.</p>
                    <p>By participating in a Contest, both Buyers and Sellers accept without any provision the Terms and Conditions of the Contests. Buyers may not allow or request Sellers to submit entries to Buyers via other means than COLLAR. During and after the submission period, Buyers will be able to award the Contest by choosing a "Winning Entry". Every awarded entry is a permanent and uncountable result. Buyers are not obliged to use the "Winning Entry".</p>
                    <p>After the submission period, no entries will be allowed to be submitted by Sellers.</p>
                    <p>Any entry which infringes on any Intellectual Property Rights will be an ineligible entry and be subject to removal by COLLAR. If Sellers submit an entry that infringes any Intellectual Property Rights, they are obliged to reimburse COLLAR. In each Contest, the owners (Sellers) of the top 5 most rated entries will be rewarded by receiving a boost in their CERT score. Sellers agree and acknowledge that such CERT points will be awarded based on calculations made by COLLAR.</p>
                    <p>The winner of the ("Contest Prize") will convey their Intellectual Property Rights to the Buyer. From then on Buyers receive the license to use the awarded entry for their own purpose. For the avoidance of doubt until an entry is awarded "Winning Entry" status all rights in submitted entries are the Sellers own.</p>
                    <p>Sellers and Buyers agree and acknowledge that COLLAR shall retain a ("Contest Commission") subtracted from the ("Contest Fee") with the ("Contest Fee") price and ("Contest Prize") advertised on our website when a Buyer posts a Contest or a Seller submits an entry. The remaining amount ("Contest Prize"), shall be paid to the Seller who submitted the "Winning Entry".</p>

                    <p>Specifically, Sellers must ensure that all deliverables are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                    <h3>3.6 The heavy but important bits:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Buyer and Seller decide on the type of Job, Hourly, Contest, custom or fixed price. They determine the terms and conditions of “Jobs” and Contests, including deliverables, any specific requirements, and for “Jobs” the price, directly between them. The Buyer and Seller create a direct service contract between themselves and COLLAR are not a party to that contract ('the Service Contract').</li>
                        <li>Subject to this being varied as part of the Service Contract, ownership in and to any materials and or deliverables arising from a Job or Contests and any intellectual property rights therein will be assigned to the Buyer upon successful payment to the Seller. If the Buyer and Seller wish to include any special terms of the contract (for example, in relation to the ownership of the work produced, ownership of intellectual property rights or special rights of termination), the Buyer and Seller should negotiate and document these terms in the Job WorkStream.</li>
                        <li>
                            Subject to variation in the Service Contract, the terms and conditions of each Job and Contest shall be deemed to incorporate a term that in consideration of the fee paid for the Job or Contest the Seller hereby assigns to the Buyer absolutely with full title guarantee the following rights throughout the world:

                                <li> all other rights in the Job or Contest of whatever nature, whether now known or created in the future, to which the Seller is now, or at any time after the date of Commencement of the Job or Contest may be, entitled by virtue of the laws in force in the United INDIA  and in any other part of the world,</li>
                                <li> in each case for the whole term including any renewals, reversions, revivals and extensions and together with all related rights and powers arising or accrued, including the right to bring, make, oppose, defend, appeal and obtain relief (and to retain any damages recovered) in respect of any infringement, or any other cause of action arising from ownership, of any of these assigned rights, whether occurring before, on, or after the date of Commencement of the Job.</li>

                        </li>

                            You promise that:
                            <ul>

                    <h3>4. Payments</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Payments are made as described in Section 3, for a Job or Contest agreed by the Buyer as successfully completed or, in the case of a Contest entry, judged the winner. The payment terms are seven (7) days except for Per Hour Contracts which is three (3) days.</li>
                        <li>For Jobs, the Seller must not request a release of funds from the Escrow Account prior to Job completion; the purpose of funds being held in the Escrow Account is to provide the Seller with the security needed for them to undertake the work. Buyers must report such cases immediately. In such cases, the Seller's account may be temporarily or permanently suspended.</li>
                        <li>For Contests, the Seller is only able to request a release of funds from the Escrow Account once their entry is judged the winner; the purpose of funds being held in the Escrow Account is to provide the Sellers with the security that funds are available to award the ("Contest Prize").</li>
                        <li>Regular payments may be made utilising the Auto Pay feature or Per Hour Contracts. COLLAR provides this facility solely to simplify the payment process. Use of this facility does not alter the nature of the relationship between COLLAR and its Users or between Buyers and Sellers.</li>
                        <li>All payments between Buyer and Seller must be processed through COLLAR as described in Section 3, both for work sourced on COLLAR and for any follow-on work between the Buyer and Seller, either for the same Job or Contest or another Job. A Seller may seek express written permission from COLLAR to allow payment by alternative means for a specific invoice or payment if the Seller intends to issue proceedings or pursue legal action against the Buyer.</li>
                        <li>Payment (or attempt of) outside of COLLAR is a breach of these terms and conditions unless the prior express wrote consent of COLLAR has been obtained. Such payment (or attempt of) and will lead to temporary and/ or permanent suspension of the Buyer and/ or Seller's account. The Seller will be liable for any loss of business and legal expenses that COLLAR may incur in recovering it. COLLAR reserve the right to sanction funds held in the Seller's Account in order to recover lost fees. Moreover, Collar will not mediate any Disputes or be liable to either the Buyer or Seller's loss of business as a result of a violation of this clause. Users must report attempts or offers to make payment outside of COLLAR by their Buyer or Seller to COLLAR immediately.</li>
                        <li>Payments by Buyers are routinely checked by COLLAR for fraud prevention purposes before any payments are released to the Seller. COLLAR aim to process these payments and credit funds to the Seller's COLLAR Account within three (3) working days, however COLLAR reserve the right to take up to ten (10) working days.</li>
                        <li>
                            To withdraw funds from their COLLAR Account a Seller needs to request a withdrawal from an authorized withdrawal account. An authorized withdrawal account can be either:
                            <ul>
                                <li>a bank account under the user's name as registered on his profile</li>
                                <li>a Paypal or Payoneer account with the same name and email address as registered on the user's profile</li>
                                <li>a Paypal or Payoneer account with the same name as registered on the user's profile and an email address that has been verified by the user</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Collar process payments daily and will send the money to the Seller via their selected payment preference. Once Collar has processed payments, they are then subject to timescales imposed by the banking clearing system (BACS in the INDIA).</li>
                        <li>

                        <li>If COLLAR has to return funds to the Buyer due to the Buyer (contrary to these Terms and Conditions) filing a dispute or requesting a payment be reversed through its credit card provider, bank or Paypal then COLLAR will be entitled to recover any such amount from the Seller’s COLLAR Account (and if insufficient monies are in the Seller’s Account), credit card or other previously made payment method if available. If COLLAR is unable to recover the amount returned to the Buyer from the Seller in full then the Seller agrees to pay to COLLAR any outstanding sums within 48 hours of COLLAR making a request.</li>
                        <li>
                            To prevent funds being held indefinitely in the Escrow Account, Collar will notify the Seller in the event of funds being held in an Escrow Account for a Job that i) does not have an unpaid Invoice nor an open Dispute; and ii) has not had any activity in the WorkStream for a period of one (1) calendar month or longer. Activity is defined as any action by the Buyer or Seller in the WorkStream such as a message posted, an Invoice is raised, a deposit into the Escrow Account made or a Refund Request raised.
                            <ul>
                                <li>The Seller will be asked to confirm either i) that the Job is still in progress by posting a message to the Buyer in the WorkStream with an update on progress; ii) that the Job has been completed by raising an Invoice in accordance with the terms defined in Section 3; or iii) that the Job was cancelled and issuing the Buyer with a refund in accordance with the terms of Section 6.</li>
                                <li>If no action is taken by the Seller within seven (7) days it will be assumed that the Job was not delivered by the Seller and the funds held in the Escrow Account will be automatically refunded back to the Buyer's COLLAR Account. In this event, the Seller's rankings will be affected in accordance with the terms in Section 6.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>COLLAR uses third-party service providers including Adyen, Worldpay, Payoneer and Paypal to process payments by Buyers and to transfer funds to Sellers.

                    <h3>5. Leaving Feedback</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When the Job is completed and the Seller has been paid by the Buyer, both parties are asked to provide both qualitative feedback and a rating from 1-5 for the other party. This rating influences each User's ranking on COLLAR. In order for a user to read a received review, they have to submit their feedback as well. A review (feedback) is published on the member profile page when both parties (Buyer and Seller) leave their feedback within the first 60 days since invoice payment (funds released / amount paid). In case 60 days have passed, any submitted review is disclosed and users that haven't left any review will no longer be able to do so.</li>
                        <li>Users can also provide their feedback while requesting (Buyer) or issue (Seller) a refund.</li>
                        <li>Both parties should complete the feedback honestly. Users must not falsify feedback, manipulate or coerce another User by threatening negative feedback or offer incentives in exchange for feedback. Any attempts of this nature should be reported immediately to COLLAR.</li>

Clients that receive invitations by Sellers through the zero service scheme and successfully sign up on COLLAR, will receive a £30 coupon which will be automatically added upon checkout of their first purchase on COLLAR (First purchase should be the equivalent of £50 or more).</p>

                    <p>If a User has funds in their COLLAR Account and the User has not logged in to their COLLAR Account for a period of six (6) months or more then COLLAR will charge a monthly administration fee of $9.95 (excl.

This fee will be automatically collected each month from the funds in the User's COLLAR Account starting from the seventh (7th) calendar month since the User last logged in to their User account.
